# 🌟 Hey there, I’m Aida Pendás Fernández! 🚀

Welcome to my corner of GitHub, where data meets creativity and science gets a dash of flair! I’m a **Data Scientist** and **Customer Success Lead** with a passion for solving puzzles, building tools, and turning chaos into insights (and sometimes even dashboards ✨).

## 👩‍💻 Who Am I?

I’m a computational problem-solver with a love for data, algorithms, and making clients say, “Wow, that’s exactly what I needed!” With nearly a decade of experience in data science, customer success, and engineering, I’ve worked across industries and countries to deliver innovative, data-driven solutions.

Whether it’s analyzing financial data, building machine learning models, or teaching people how to make the most of their tools, I’m all about unlocking potential—mine, yours, and the tech we use!
